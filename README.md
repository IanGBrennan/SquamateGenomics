# Squamate Genomics

This repository holds data for squamate reptile genomics projects associated with the Australian Amphibian and Reptile Genomics ([AusARG](https://ausargenomics.com/)) initiative. 

The main databases are split into genomic coding sequence ([CDS](https://github.com/IanGBrennan/SquamateGenomics/tree/main/CDS)) and anchored hybrid enrichment ([AHE](https://github.com/IanGBrennan/SquamateGenomics/tree/main/AHE)) targets extracted from squamate genomes.  

These targets have been mined from [NCBI](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/datasets/genome/?taxon=8509) squamate genomes using [ALiBaSeq](https://github.com/AlexKnyshov/alibaseq), aligned with [MAFFT](https://mafft.cbrc.jp/alignment/software/), and refined with [MACSE](https://www.agap-ge2pop.org/macse/).
